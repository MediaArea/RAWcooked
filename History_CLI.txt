Thanks to New York Public Library (NYPL) for their vision and support on this release
Thanks to British Film Institute (BFI) for their extensive testing
Reversibility checking: an option to check after encoding to ensure that the decoding of a RAWcooked file is fully reversible (--check)
Reversibility checking: an option to embed checksums of the input files  to enable the possibility of later reversibility integrity checks without requiring access to the original  input files (--hash)
Conformance checking: an option to to perform a selection of DPX implementation checks (--conch), more to come
Coherency checking: an option to check e.g. that audio duration is same as video duration (--coherency, by default)
A new requirement when encoding DPX with padding bits to specify user preferences for the evaluation of padding bits (--check-padding or --no-check-padding) as some DPX files use padding bits for unstandardized purposes.
An option to offer extra information about the content of the reversibility data (--info)
Perform --info --check --hash --conch --coherency --check-padding --encode in a single option (--all)
Support additional post-encoding coherency checks, such as a quick check of the resulting compressed file in order to be sure that FFmpeg correctly finished the encoding.
Fix reversibility issues if DPX header does not have the same size in all files
