.SH NAME
\fBRAWcooked\fR - encode and decode audio-visual RAW data with Matroska, FFV1 and FLAC
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrawcooked \fR[\fIoption\fR ...] (\fIfolder\fR | \fIfile\fR ...) [\fIoption\fR ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.TP
\fBRAWcooked\fR easily encodes RAW audio-visual sequences into a lossless video stream, reducing the file size by between one and two thirds. FFmpeg encodes the audio-visual data into a Matroska container (.mkv) using the video codec FFV1, and audio codec FLAC. The metadata accompanying the RAW data is fully preserved, along with additional sidecar files such as MD5 checksums, LUT or XML if desired. This allows for the management of these audio-visual file formats in an effective and transparent way. The lossless Matroska video stream can be played in VLC or MPV media players, and writing and retrieving from storage devices such as LTO is significantly quicker.
.TP
If you need to use the RAW source in its original form, one line of code will easily restore it \fBbit-by-bit\fR, faster than retrieving the same file from LTO tape storage.
.TP
.I folder
Every image file within the sequence's \fIfolder\fR is encoded into a single FFV1 video stream, and each audio track within the same \fIfolder\fR is encoded to the FLAC codec. Both the FFV1 and FLAC contents are then muxed into a single Matroska container (.mkv).
.br
The image filenames must end in a complete number sequence, so that \fBRAWcooked\fR can parse each image within the sequence in the correct order.
.TP
.I file
.B contains RAW data (e.g. a .dpx or .wav file):
.br
Every image within a sequence folder containing the \fIfile\fR is encoded into a single FFV1 video stream, and each audio track within the folder containing the same \fIfile\fR is encoded to the FLAC codec. Both the FFV1 and FLAC contents are then muxed into a single Matroska container (.mkv).
.br
The image filenames must end in a complete number sequence. By entering one \fIfile\fR within this sequence \fBRAWcooked\fR will parse every image in the correct order.
.TP
.I file
.B is a Matroska container (.mkv):
.br
Decodes the Matroska file back to the original RAW image sequence, including restoration of the original metadata and sidecar files. It is important to stress that the encoded files can be fully decoded, and that this process will create bit-by-bit identical files to the originals. Not only is the image and audio content fully restored, but also all enclosed metadata and all of the file's characteristics. Therefore, an encoded and decoded RAW file cannot be differentiated from its original.

.SS ACTIONS
.TP
.B --all
Same as --info --conch --decode --encode --hash --coherency --check-padding --check --accept-gaps (see below)
.TP
.B --none
Same as --no-info --no-conch --no-decode --no-encode --no-hash --no-coherency --quick-check-padding --quick-check (see below)
.TP
.B --check
Check that the encoded file can be correctly decoded.
.br
If input is raw content, encode then check that output would be same as the input content.
.br
If input is compressed content, check that output would be same as the original content.
.br
Disables decoding.
.TP
.B --quick-check
Run quick coherency checks of the encoded file. Allows user to check that the file seems healthy without the additional time taken to process the full check command.
.br
Is ignored in case of compressed content.
.br
This is the default, but may change in the future.
.TP
.B --no-check
Don't run any checks (see above).
.br
This is the default, but may change in the future.
.TP
.B --info
Provides extra information about the compressed file, for example the presence of hashes for the raw data.
.br
Disables encoding and decoding.
.TP
.B --no-info
Don't provide extra information (see above).
.br
This is the default, but may change in the future.
.TP
.B --check-padding
Runs padding checks for DPX files that have no zero padding. Data found in the padding is stored in the RAWcooked reversibility file. Be aware check function can be demanding of time and processor usage.
.br
It is a slower process but guarantees reversibility.
.TP
.B --quick-check-padding
Switch to --check-padding or --no-check-padding depending on what is found in the first image.
.br
The program will stop with an error code if --check is not used at the same time and zero-padding bits are in the content, asking to choose what to do.
.br
This is the default, but may change in the future.
.TP
.B --no-check-padding
Do not run padding checks, as they are demanding of time and processor usage.
.br
This method is quicker, but be aware it may lead to partial reversibility with files that do no conform.
.TP
.B --coherency
Checks that the package and contents are coherent. For example, is the audio file duration the same as the image sequence duration, or are there gaps in the sequence numbering.
.br
This is currently partially implemented.
.br
This is default, but may change in the future.
.TP
.B --no-coherency
Do not carry out coherency check (see above).
.TP
.B --conch
Conformance check of the format, effective only when format is supported.
.br
This is currently partially implemented for DPX.
.br
Disable encoding and decoding.
.TP
.B --no-conch
Do not carry out conformance check (see above).
.br
This is default, but may change in the future.
.TP
.B --decode
Encode a compressed stream into audio-visual RAW data.
.br
This is default.
.TP
.B --no-decode
Do not carry out decode (see above).
.TP
.B --encode
Encode audio-visual RAW data into a compressed stream.
.br
This is default.
.TP
.B --no-encode
Do not carry out encode (see above).
.TP
.B --hash
Computes the hash of audio-visual RAW data files.
.br
During encoding it computes a hash for each file within a source folder and stores this within the RAWcooked reversibility metadata for comparison during --check or --check-padding.
.br
During decoding of a matroska with hashes in the metadata the file is decoded and new hashes generated for the which are then tested against the source file hashes stored in the metadata. Any issues raised by this check is considered a decoding error. This permits a reversibility check without the original files.
.TP
.B --no-hash
Do not compute or test the hash of the file (see above).
.br
This is default, but may change in the future.
.TP
.B --framemd5
Compute the framemd5 of input frames and store it to a sidecar file.
.br
See FFmpeg framemd5 documentation for more information.
.TP
.B --framemd5-name \fIvalue\fR
Set the name of the framemd5 file to \fIvalue\fR.
.br
Default value is \fI${Input}.framemd5\fR.
.TP
.B --no-framemd5
Do not compute the framemd5 of input frames. (see above).
.br
Is default.
.TP
.B --accept-gaps
Use if there are missing files within the sequence numbering. RAWcooked creates a concatenated list of all files ensuring the sequence can be encoded.
.TP
.B --no-accept-gaps
Do not accept-gaps within the sequence numbering. FFmpeg will fail any encoding attempts where gaps are present.
.TP
.SS INPUT RELATED OPTIONS

.br
The default value is variable between \fI16\fR and \fI512\fR, depending on the video frame size and depth.
.SH EXAMPLE: Encoding using the --all action
.B rawcooked --all /path_to_av_raw_data/
This command comprises several commands into one '--all' (see above) that ensures safe image sequence encoding steps are taken. Please see individual flag differences to understand the differences between its use during encoding and decoding.
.br
It can be used in conjunction with opposing commands. For example if you want to use this command without --conch, you can add --no-conch after the --all and the conch command will be skipped.
.SH EXAMPLE: Custom encoding with export of console messages to log file
.B rawcooked --check --coherency --conch --hash --encode -framerate 24 /path_to_av_raw_data/ >> RAWcooked_encoding.log
If you want to retain the console output of the RAWcooked encoding or decoding processes, you can set the stdout to a separate log file. This option is useful if you're automating batch encodings and need to assess the log outputs to make decisions within the logic of your code.
.SH EXAMPLE: Decoding using --all action
.B rawcooked --all <file.mkv>
This command works the same as the encoding of raw audio-visual data, but decodes the Matroska file back to it's original raw state. Please see individual flag differences (above) to understand the differences between its use during encoding and decoding.
.br
It can be used in conjunction with opposing commands. For example if you want to use this command without --conch, you can add --no-conch after the --all and the conch command will be skipped.
